1. Simple Figures.
   - Shape is an abstract base class that defines pure virtual functions Move, Rotate, and Print, which all derived classes must implement.
   - Point represents a point in a 2D plane. It inherits from Shape and implements the virtual functions. It has member variables for x and y coordinates and functions to move and rotate the point.
   - Line represents a line segment between two points. It also inherits from Shape and implements the virtual functions. It has member variables for the starting and ending points and functions to move, rotate, and get the midpoint of the line.
   - Circle represents a circle with a center point and radius. It also inherits from Shape and implements the virtual functions. It has member variables for the center point and radius and functions to move and rotate the circle.
   - Aggregate represents a collection of shapes. It inherits from Shape and implements the virtual functions. It has a vector to store the shapes and functions to add shapes, move the entire aggregate, rotate the entire aggregate, and print all shapes in the aggregate.
